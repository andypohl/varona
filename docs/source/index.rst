"Varona" is named as a near-portmanteau of "variant" and "annotation".
Actually, the near-portmanteau was originally conceived as "Verona", in
homage to Italian city home to Romeo and Juliet. However, after seeing
that a `Verona PyPi library already exists <https://pypi.org/project/verona/>`_, "Varona" was chosen.
